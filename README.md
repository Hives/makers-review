# Makers review

## Instructions

The exercise was to make a text converter which took a string as an input and replaced any mathematical expressions with their evaluation (e.g. "2+1" is replaced with "3"). There was a bit of role playing at the start where I had to talk to Sam to find out the acceptance criteria.

## Feedback

Sam's full feedback is [here](paul-martin.pdf). In particular he suggested these points for improvement:
> - Do watch out for introducing edge cases a little too early. Introducing the " 2+" string was quite a trick case to handle.
> - If you have the benefit of having the user nearby, it's a good idea to check acceptance criteria frequently – at one point, you programmed some acceptance criteria that weren't accurate for me as a user.
> - During a tech interview, I'd strongly advise narrating your process out-loud as it gives an insight into your working processes which, as an interviewer, I didn't otherwise have access to. While you program in a very intentional way, I think adding some narration – at least a quick overview of your intentions every so often – would only stand to enhance this approach.
